### Hi there üëã I'm Alex 

<!-- <h2 align="center"> üë®‚Äçüíª Whoami</h2> -->
<p>

I am a passionate and detail-oriented student pursuing a Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence for Smart Sensors/Actuators, with a solid foundation in data analytics, machine learning, and IT support. My academic journey, combined with hands-on experience as a Machine Learning Intern and IT Support Assistant, has allowed me to develop strong technical skills in Python, SQL, system administration (Windows and Linux), and database management.

I have worked on a range of projects, from developing machine learning models for real estate price prediction to creating system monitoring dashboards for IT infrastructure management. In addition to my technical expertise, I have a keen interest in contributing to research-driven environments, as demonstrated by my enthusiasm for roles in the aerospace and technology sectors.

Currently, I am looking for opportunities to apply my skills in IT management, data analysis, and software development, where I can make meaningful contributions while continuing to grow professionally. I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex challenges with innovative, data-driven solutions.

Key Skills:

Python, SQL, JavaScript<br>
System Administration (Windows/Linux)<br>
Machine Learning & Data Analysis<br>
IT Support & Infrastructure Management<br>
Database Management (Oracle, PostgreSQL)<br>
Cloud Computing (Google Cloud)<br>
LowCode App Development (Oracle Apex)<br>

If you‚Äôre looking for someone who can bring both technical skills and a passion for innovation, feel free to connect!
